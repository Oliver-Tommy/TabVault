# TabVault

TabVault is an online platform designed to help creators organize, store, and manage their guitar tabs. The platform allows users to bookmark tabs for easy access and manage them through a secure dashboard. This project is part of the Code Institute's Full-Stack Developer course and focuses on the Django framework, database management, and CRUD functionality.

## Overview

TabVault is a comprehensive platform designed for guitar tab creators and enthusiasts that enables:
- Storage and organization of guitar tabs
- Sharing and distribution to fans and students
- A streamlined, user-friendly experience for both creators and consumers
- Professional presentation of the content

Guitar content creators often struggle with effectively sharing their tablature, either relying on third-party websites with limited features or building costly custom solutions. TabVault bridges this gap by providing a dedicated platform where creators can easily upload, manage and distribute their guitar tabs to their audience. The platform is built with the potential forfuture scalability in mind, with possibilities for a creator-based system, with paid access to tabs.

## UX - User Experience

### Colour Scheme

<b>Linen (#FFF1E6):</b> Clean and warm backgrounds.

<b>Fairy Tale (#FEC8D8):</b> For primary buttons (download link).

<b>Melon (#F8B195):</b> For hover states.

<b>Platinum (#E6E6E6):</b> Borders & dividers.

<b>Space cadet (#2F2E41):</b> Text.

<b>Mint green (#B8E1DD):</b> Secondary buttons

![Image of the colours used](readme/images/colour-scheme.jpg)

### Font
<b>Merriweather (for titles):</b> Was chosen for titles as it is highly readable, with a traditional, formal feel. 

<b>Roboto (for body text):</b> Was chosen for the body text, as it is clean and legible. Also, it's popularity and widespread use provides the user with familiarity. 

The contrast in style between the 'classic' Merriweather and the more 'modern' Roboto helps draw attention to headings and provides a clear visual separation.

## Project Planning

### Site Goals
- Allow users to bookmark and manage tabs.
- Provide an accessible dashboard that displays relevant information clearly.
- Full responsivity across all devices and screen sizes.
- Enable easy tab uploads and downloads.
- Implement a review and rating system.
- Maintain high performance and fast load times.
- Provide comprehensive search capabilities.
- Enable easy content management for creators.

### Project Management
This project was primarily managed through GitHub's project board functionality. Issues were created for all major features and tasks, each categorized using MoSCoW prioritization (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have) to ensure proper resource allocation and timely delivery.

The GitHub project board was organized into the following columns:
- To Do: New issues and tasks to be worked on
- In Progress: Currently being developed
- Done: Completed and verified features

For day-to-day task management and smaller items that didn't need issues, I maintained a physical to-do list to track minor bug fixes, small UI improvements, and other quick tasks.

## Security

Django's built-in security features handle all data securely:

- Passwords are encrypted using Django's default PBKDF2 algorithm with SHA256 hash
- All forms are protected against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks using Django's middleware
- User authentication and authorization restricts access based on roles:
  - Only authenticated users can access bookmarking features
  - Only authenticated users can submit reviews
  - Admin users have full access to the Django admin interface
- Database queries are protected against SQL injection through Django's ORM
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) protection is enabled by default
- Clickjacking protection via X-Frame-Options middleware
- Debug mode is disabled in production
- Secure password validation enforces:
  - Minimum length requirements
  - Common password checking
  - Numeric character requirements

## Features

### User View - Unregistered
- When a user is unregistered, they have access to all tabs, with the ability to search, fully navigate and download.
- However, the user is unable to leave a review, or access the bookmarking page and feature.

### Reviews
- When a user is logged in, they can submit a review for each tab, with a 1-5 star rating and additional text. 
- The star ratings are stored for each tab, and they are aggregated and averaged, then displayed to the user.

### Navigation bar
- When a user isn't logged in, the navigation bar displays options to login and register.
- When a user is logged in, only the logout option appears.
- The navbar is fully responsive, with a dropdown appearing on tablet-sized screens and smaller.
- The users login status is displayed.

### Search bar
- The navigation bar has a search bar present, which allows users to search for the tab title, artist, and genre.

### Bookmark Feature
- When logged in, and viewing a tab_detail page, the user can either add or remove the tab to their 'bookmarks'.
- The user can access their bookmarked tabs, using the bookmarked tabs button on the navigation bar.
- In the bookmarked_tabs page, the user's bookmarked tabs are displayed.

### View count
- When a user visits a particular tab_detail page, the view count increments by 1.

## Future Features

### Many creators
- Currently the site is for the use of only one creator, as many such websites are.
- In the future, many users, apon admin validation, will be able to have a 'creator' account, with the ability to create profiles and add tabs with full CRUD functionality.

Python was tested for PEP8 compatibilty using the <a href="https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/">CI Python Linter</a>, and the python files: models.py, test_form.py, urls.py and views.py were edited for easier readability.


### Lighthouse testing

Mobile testing demonstrated strong results across most metrics:
- High accessibility score
- Strong best practices implementation 
- Good SEO optimization
- Slightly reduced performance due to render-blocking resources

![Image of the mobile lighthouse test](readme/images/mobile-lighthouse.png)

The performance impact was primarily due to render-blocking resources:

### Bugs
During development, several bugs were encountered and resolved:

1. Static Files Loading Issue:
   - Problem: Static files (particularly style.css) weren't loading on index.html and search_results.html pages in the deployed site
   - Solution: Added {% load static %} to the affected templates and verified static file configuration in settings.py
   - Temporary workaround required manual collectstatic commands until fully resolved

2. Search Functionality:
   - Problem: Search results were not displaying correctly when using special characters
   - Solution: Implemented proper URL encoding and input sanitization

3. Mobile Navigation:
   - Problem: Hamburger dropdown menu wasn't responding on some mobile devices
   - Solution: Changed the bootstrap classes to ensure the dropdown menu was working

4. PDF file validation:
   - Problem: PDF files were not being validated
   - Solution: Added a validation function to the model

All identified bugs were documented, tracked, and resolved to ensure optimal site functionality.


## Deployment

Throughout the development process, the site was deployed to Heroku from the main repository branch. The following steps were taken to ensure successful deployment:

1. Environment Setup:
   - Created a requirements.txt file using `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to track all Python dependencies
   - Added a Procfile containing `web: gunicorn tabvault.wsgi` to configure the Gunicorn web server
   - Updated settings.py to include both Heroku app URL and localhost in ALLOWED_HOSTS

2. Database Configuration:
   - Set up a PostgreSQL database instance on ElephantSQL
   - Connected the database to the application using the DATABASE_URL environment variable
   - Ran migrations to set up the database schema

3. Environment Variables:
   The following config vars were set in Heroku:
   - DATABASE_URL: PostgreSQL database connection string
   - SECRET_KEY: Django secret key for security
   - CLOUDINARY_URL: Connection string for Cloudinary media storage
   These replaced the local variables from env.py which was excluded from version control

4. Static Files:
   - Configured Cloudinary for static and media file hosting
   - Ran collectstatic to gather all static files

5. Deployment Steps:
   - Connected GitHub repository to Heroku application
   - Verified build logs and ensured successful deployment
   - Confirmed application was running correctly on Heroku URL

6. Post-Deployment:
   - Tested all functionality on live site
   - Verified database connections and migrations
   - Confirmed static files were being served correctly
   - Checked all environment variables were working as expected
